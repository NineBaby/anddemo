# HAL AND Demo
This is a very simple HAL AND demo. To start the demo download the latest and
greatest version of the MachinekitClient from the build server:
[MachinekitClient Builds](http://buildbot.roessler.systems/files/machinekit-client/)

## Starting the demo
You can start the Machinekit demo application by running the start script:
``` shell
./run.py
```

Now you can proceed by starting the MachinekitClient you have previously
downloaded.
