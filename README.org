* HAL AND Demo
This is a very simple HAL AND demo. To start the demo download the latest and
greatest version of the MachinekitClient from the build server:
[[http://buildbot.roessler.systems/files/machinekit-client/][MachinekitClient Builds]]

** Starting the demo
First you need to start mklauncher on your host computer. Make sure to either
run the command in the directory containing the configuration or in a parent
directory. E.g. for running mklauncher in the current directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
mklauncher .
#+END_SRC

Now you can proceed by starting the MachinekitClient you have previously
downloaded.
